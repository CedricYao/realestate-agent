## üîç Analysis & Investigation

### Codebase Structure
The current codebase is minimal. The project will be built from scratch as a Python application based on the `real-estate-agent-design.md`.

### Current Architecture
The architecture uses the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) as its core. The key components are:
- **ADK Agent**: Processes user requests.
- **Home Search Tool**: Searches for properties via an external API.
- **Virtual Staging Tool**: Generates virtually staged images using `google-genai` configured for a Vertex AI backend.

Interaction will be via a command-line interface (CLI), and configuration will be managed via `.env` files.

### Dependencies & Integration Points
- **`google-adk`**: The core framework for the agent.
- **`google-genai`**: To interact with Vertex AI for image generation.
- **`python-dotenv`**: To load configuration from `.env` files.
- **Real Estate API**: An external API for property data (to be mocked initially).
- **UV**: The package manager for Python dependencies.
- **Google Cloud SDK**: For authenticating with Vertex AI.

### Considerations & Challenges
- **API Keys & Secrets Management**: Vertex AI configuration (`PROJECT`, `LOCATION`) will be managed via a `.env` file, loaded at runtime. A `.env.copy` template will be committed to the repository. The actual `.env` file will be git-ignored. Vertex AI authentication will be handled via Application Default Credentials.
- **Real Estate API Choice**: The plan will start with a generic, mocked interface.
- **Prompt Engineering**: The quality of the virtual staging depends on the prompts sent to the image model.
- **Error Handling**: The agent needs to handle potential errors from all external services gracefully.

## üìù Implementation Plan

### Prerequisites
1.  **Install Python**: Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed.
2.  **Install UV**: Install the `uv` package manager (e.g., `pip install uv`).
3.  **Google Cloud Account**: A Google Cloud project with the Vertex AI API enabled is required.
4.  **gcloud CLI**: The Google Cloud CLI must be installed and configured (`gcloud auth application-default login`).

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1.  **Step 1: Project Setup & Initialization**
    - **Action**: Initialize a `pyproject.toml`-based Python project, set up the environment, and add dependencies using `uv add`.
    - **Implementation Notes**: Created the `real_estate_agent` and `tests` directories. Initialized a `uv` virtual environment and a `pyproject.toml` file. Added `google-adk`, `google-genai`, `Pillow`, and `python-dotenv` dependencies using `uv add`. Created `.env.copy` as a template for environment variables. Verified that `.gitignore` already ignores `.env` files.
    - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

2.  **Step 2: Configure Vertex AI Authentication**
    - **Action**: Ensure Vertex AI authentication is configured.
    - **Implementation Notes**: Authentication is handled via Application Default Credentials, which are set up by running `gcloud auth application-default login` as specified in the prerequisites. No code changes are needed for this step.
    - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

3.  **Step 3: Implement the Home Search Tool**
    - **Action**: Create the `HomeSearchTool` with a mocked API response.
    - **Implementation Notes**: Created the `real_estate_agent/tools/home_search.py` file and defined the `search_homes` function with a mock implementation as specified.
    - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

4.  **Step 4: Implement the Virtual Staging Tool**
    - **Action**: Create the `VirtualStagingTool` to perform image inpainting using Vertex AI.
    - **Implementation Notes**: Created `real_estate_agent/tools/virtual_staging.py` and implemented the `stage_image` function. It uses `google-genai` to call the `imagen-3.0-capability-001` model on Vertex AI for image editing.
    - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

5.  **Step 5: Create the ADK Agent**
    - **Action**: Set up the main ADK agent and integrate the tools.
    - **Implementation Notes**: Created `real_estate_agent/agent.py` and configured the ADK Agent with the `search_homes` and `stage_image` tools.
    - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

6.  **Step 6: Build the Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
    - **Action**: Remove custom CLI and use built-in ADK runner.
    - **Implementation Notes**: Deleted the custom `cli.py` and removed the corresponding script entry from `pyproject.toml`. The agent is now run using the `adk run` command.
    - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**:
    - **Implementation Notes**: All unit tests passed successfully using `pytest`.
    - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
- **Integration Tests**:
    - **Implementation Notes**: Successfully ran the agent using `uv run adk run real_estate_agent` and verified the `search_homes` tool functionality.
    - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
